## About

The aim of this project was to create a simulation of a 3-D bipedal walking robot, simulating all contact forces and joint torques. In addition to this, there was added scope to incorporate optimization of motion through a neural network and machine learning. Before this could be completed - I used a simple iterative optimization function to run the simulation using every possible motion within set bounds. Following this, I created an analyser function to sum certain values, and return the motion that best fit a certain profile.
